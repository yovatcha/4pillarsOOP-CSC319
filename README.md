# Four Pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that revolves around the concept of objects. There are four main principles, often referred to as the "four pillars," that guide the design and implementation of object-oriented systems. These pillars are:

## 1. Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, known as a class. It hides the internal state of objects from the outside world and only exposes the necessary functionality. Encapsulation helps in achieving data hiding, abstraction, and modularity.

## 2. Inheritance

Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class, called a subclass or derived class, inherits properties and behaviors from an existing class, called a superclass or base class. It allows the subclass to reuse code from the superclass, promoting code reusability and reducing redundancy. Inheritance establishes an "is-a" relationship between classes.

## 3. Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables the same method to behave differently based on the object it is called on. There are two types of polymorphism: compile-time (method overloading) and runtime (method overriding). Polymorphism enhances flexibility, extensibility, and maintainability of code.

## 4. Abstraction

Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on real-world entities and their interactions. It focuses on essential features while hiding unnecessary details. Abstraction allows programmers to deal with high-level concepts without worrying about low-level implementation details. It promotes code clarity, reduces complexity, and facilitates code maintenance.

These four pillars collectively form the foundation of object-oriented design and programming. By adhering to these principles, developers can create modular, maintainable, and scalable software systems.
